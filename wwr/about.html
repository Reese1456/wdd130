                <h2>History</h2>
                <div class="grid-container">
                    <p class="grid-item">White Water Rafting was founded in 1995 by adventure enthusiasts Emily and Jack Thompson. Inspired by their thrilling experiences navigating the rapids of the Colorado River, they wanted to share their love for white water rafting with others. What started as a small operation with just a few rafts and a handful of eager adventurers quickly grew into a well-respected business. Emily and Jack's commitment to safety, coupled with their passion for the sport, earned White Water Rafting a loyal customer base. Over the years, the company expanded its offerings to include a variety of trips suitable for all skill levels, from serene float tours to adrenaline-pumping Class V rapids.</p>
                    <p class="grid-item">Our love for white water rafting stems from the unique combination of exhilaration and tranquility that the sport offers. There's nothing quite like the rush of navigating through turbulent waters, surrounded by stunning natural landscapes. At White Water Rafting, we believe that every trip down the river is an opportunity to connect with nature, bond with friends and family, and challenge oneself in a thrilling yet safe environment. Our experienced guides are dedicated to providing an unforgettable experience, sharing their knowledge of the rivers and the local ecosystem. Join us and discover why we are passionate about rafting and why so many adventurers choose White Water Rafting for their river escapades.</p>
